# nextGen project repository


*** DO NOT APPLY - HTTPS IS INACTIVE ***
<!-- Setting up HTTPS:

1. If you don't have, create a "certs" folder in the "nextGen-backend" directory.
2. Go into the "certs" directory and run the following command: openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365
3. give "nextgen" as passphrase, the rest of the questions are irrelevant ("nextgen" passphrase is hard-coded)
4. This will create a cert and a key -.pem file. These are necessary for the HTTPS configuration.
5. Code is setup, no other change is necessary.
6. Run the server.
7. Open https://localhost:9000/user/reg
8. You will receive an error message sayin this is is an unthrusted site etc.
9. In chrome browser go bottom left in the advanced setting and allow passing.
10. Without these steps the frontend will give back an "unauthorised" error. -->
